This is one of many discrete event simulations I created to model network routing based on different load prioritization algorithms. It is meant to model the flow of jobs through a data center network under the "processor sharing" algorithm. I then simulated under different different load frequencies (this can be thought of as 'stress' on the network) to understand which routing algorithms are best suited for the specific needs of a data center network.
